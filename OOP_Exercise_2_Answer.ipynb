        "# Joke Fetcher and Saver\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background:\n",
        "In this exercise, you will create a Python program to fetch jokes from a free API and save them to a text file. This exercise will help you practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by designing and implementing classes to handle different aspects of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Description:\n",
        "Your task is to create two classes, JokeFetcher and JokeSaver, and write a Python program that utilizes these classes to fetch jokes from the API (https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) and save them to a text file.\n",
        "\n",
        "## JokeFetcher Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Create a JokeFetcher class with the following methods:\n",
        "__init__(self, api_url): Initialize the class with the API URL.\n",
        "fetch_joke(self): Send an HTTP GET request to the API URL and retrieve a random joke. Return the joke as a tuple of strings, where the first string represents the joke setup, and the second string represents the punchline. Handle exceptions for failed API requests.\n",
        "JokeSaver Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Create a JokeSaver class with the following methods:\n",
        "__init__(self, file_name): Initialize the class with the name of the text file where jokes will be saved.\n",
        "save_joke(self, setup, punchline): Append the setup and punchline of a joke to the text file specified during initialization. Each joke should be formatted with \"Setup:\" and \"Punchline:\" labels. Add newline characters between jokes.\n",
        "Main Program:\n",
        "\n",
        "## In the main part of your program:\n",
        "Create instances of the JokeFetcher and JokeSaver classes.\n",
        "Prompt the user to specify the number of jokes they want to fetch and save.\n",
        "Use a loop to fetch the specified number of jokes from the API and save them to the text file using the JokeFetcher and JokeSaver instances.\n",
        "Display a success message after each joke is saved.\n",
        "Testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Test your program by fetching and saving a few jokes.\n",
        "Ensure that the saved text file contains the jokes in the specified format.\n",
        "Constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "The API URL is fixed as \"https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke.\"\n",
        "The text file name for saving jokes is fixed as \"jokes.txt.\"\n",
        "The number of jokes to fetch and save is a positive integer.\n",
        "## Note:\n",
        "Feel free to add error handling, improve the user interface, or extend the functionality of your classes and program as needed. The goal is to create a functional and well-structured solution using OOP principles."
